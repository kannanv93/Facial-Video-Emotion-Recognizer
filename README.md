# Facial-Video-Emotion-Recognizer

In this project, we have implemented a Convolutional Neural Network based facial
emotion recognition (FER) system on basic emotions and conducted a comparative
analysis to understand the cognitive processing with which human beings perceive
emotions vis-a-vis Video Facial Expression Recognition systems.
